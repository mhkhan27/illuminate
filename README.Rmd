## Overview
illuminate is designed for making the data analysis easy and less time consuming. The package is based on tidyr, dplyr,srvyr packages. Most common functions are- 

* `read_sheets()` read all sheet in an excel file and makes sure that data stores in appropriate data type. 
* `survey_analysis()` calculate the weighted mean/proporation and un weighted count for all existing variable is the dataset. 
* `write_formatted_excel()` write formatted excel.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mhkhan27/illuminate")

```


## EXAMPLE :: Survey analysis 

##### Step 0:: Call libraries

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
library(srvyr)
library(illuminate)
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
library(openxlsx)

```




##### Step 1:: Read data
Read data with `read_sheets()`. This will make sure your data is stored as appropriate data type. It is important to make sure that all the select multiple are stored as logical, otherwise un weighted count will be wrong. It is recommended to use the `read_sheets()` to read the data. use ``?read_sheets()` for more details. 

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
read_sheets("data/data.xlsx",data_type_fix = T,remove_all_NA_col = T,na_strings = c("NA",""," "))
```
The avobe code will give a dataframe  called `data_up`



##### Step OPTIONAL:: Preaparing the data

<span style="color: red;">ONLY APPLICABLE WHEN YOU ARE NOT READING YOUR DATA WITH `read_sheets()`</span>

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# data_up <- read_excel("data/data.xlsx")
data_up <- fix_data_type(df = data_up)
```


##### Step 2:: Weight calculation
To do the weighted analysis, you will need to calculate the weights. If your dataset already have the weights column then you can ignore this part

###### Read sampleframe
``` {r, eval=F}
read_sheets("data/sampling_frame.xlsx")

```


This will give a dataframe called `sampling frame`

``` {r, eval=F}
weights <- data_up %>% group_by(governorate1) %>% summarise(
  survey_count = n()
) %>% left_join(sampling_frame,by =c("governorate1"="strata.names")) %>% 
  mutate(sample_global=sum(survey_count),
         pop_global=sum(population),
         survey_weight= (population/pop_global)/(survey_count/sample_global)) %>% select(governorate1,survey_weight)

```



###### Add weights to the dataframe
``` {r, eval=FALSE}
data_up <- data_up %>% left_join(weights)
```





##### Step 3.1:: Weighted analysis

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
overall_analysis <- survey_analysis(df = data_up,weights = T,weight_column = "survey_weight",strata = "governorate1")

```

##### Step 3.2:: Unweighted analysis

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
overall_analysis <- survey_analysis(df = data_up,weights = F)

```

##### Step 3.3:: Weighted and disaggregated by gender analysis

Use `?survey_analysis()` to know about the perameters. 

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
columns_to_analyze <- data_up[20:30] %>% names() # dummy code. Please define the name of the columns which you would like to analyze. Default will analyze all the variables exist in the dataset. 

analysis_by_gender <-  survey_analysis(df = data_up,weights = T,weight_column = "survey_weight",vars_to_analyze = columns_to_analyze,
                                       strata = "governorate1",disag = "gender_speaker")
```



##### Step 4:: Export with `write_formatted_excel()`
You can use any function to export the analysis however `write_formatted_excel()` can export formatted file. See the documentation for more details

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
write_list <- list(overall_analysis ="overall_analysis",
                   analysis_by_gender ="analysis_by_gender"
)

write_formatted_excel(write_list,"analysis_output.xlsx",
                      header_front_size = 12,
                      body_front = "Times")
```
