illuminate is designed for making the data analysis easy and time consuming. The package is based on tidyr, dplyr, stringr packages. The package now have different function including- 
<p>1. freq_by_questions
2. freq_by_choices 
3. merge_kml
4. kml_to_shp
5. pic_to_pdf
6. quick_survey
7. quick_survey
8. simple_chi_square_test</p>

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mhkhan27/illuminate")
## Example
```

### survey_frequency_by_questions ()
survey_frequency_by_questions() can very usefull to calculate the number of response/available data (n) for each question asked to reponsedent. You can use aggregation level/s to the function. The defult aggregation level is NULL which ideally provides the overall response count  

###### Frequency by questions (with no aggregation level)
``` {r}
# library(illuminate)
# using air quality
frequency_df_no_aggregation <- illuminate::survey_frequency_by_questions(df =airquality)

```

```{r}

frequency_df_no_aggregation %>% knitr::kable() 

```

###### Frequency by questions (with aggregation level)
``` {r}
# using air quality from base r

frequency_df_with_aggregation <- illuminate::survey_frequency_by_questions(df =airquality,aggregation_level = "Month" ) 

```

```{r}

frequency_df_with_aggregation %>% knitr::kable() 

```


### survey_frequency_by_choices ()
survey_frequency_by_choices() provides the count by each choice. suppose in the following example we have a dataset of 100 observation

###### Generating random dataset
```{r}

df_for_fre_by_choices <- data.frame(
  gender = rep(c("male","female","male",NA),10),
  upazila =rep(c("teknaf","Ukhiya"),20)
)
 
cols_to_analyze <- names(df_for_fre_by_choices) # column names 
```

###### Frequency by choices (with no aggregation level)
```{r}

fre_by_choice_no_aggregation <-illuminate::survey_frequency_by_choices(df = df_for_fre_by_choices,variables_to_analyze = cols_to_analyze)

```


```{r}

fre_by_choice_no_aggregation %>% knitr::kable() 

```

###### Frequency by choices (with aggregation level)
```{r}

fre_by_choice_with_aggregation <-illuminate::survey_frequency_by_choices(df = df_for_fre_by_choices,variables_to_analyze = cols_to_analyze,aggregation_level = "upazila")

```


```{r}
fre_by_choice_with_aggregation %>% knitr::kable() 
```
